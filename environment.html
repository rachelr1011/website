        <p>
          We love our planet just as much as you do. That's why Sunergy produces
          Earth-friendly technology that generates power in a sustainable way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most electricity is currently generated using fossil fuels like coal
          and oil. There are two problems with this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fossil fuel supplies are limited and running out fast.</li>
          <li>
            Using these fossil fuels to generate power builds up greenhouse
            gases in the atmosphere.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="image-row">

          <div class="side-text">
            <p><strong>Solar power is different:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Unlike fossil fuels, solar power relies on a power source that
                is not going to run out any time soon: the Sun!
              </li>
              <li>
                Using solar power technology to generate power does not result
                in the emission of any greenhouse gases.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              What's more, Sunergy's optimised solar panels are designed and
              manufactured in a way which ensures the smallest possible impact
              on the environment.
