          The process of converting the sun's energy into power for your home is
          pretty straightforward.

          <li>
            A solar panel attached to your roof (or other place where it will
            have maximum sun exposure) converts the sunlight into DC current.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most houses use AC current, so an inverter is used to convert this
            DC current to AC current.
          </li>
          <li>
            This current is sent to your home's electrical system and is used to
            power all your lights, appliances and anything else needing
            electricity in your home. Because the solar panel cannot produce
            power at night, you go back to drawing electricity directly from the
            power grid.
          </li>
          <li>
            In many cases solar panels are able to generate more power during
            the day than you use in the home. This extra electricity is then
            credited on the grid.
          </li>
